# Git Hooks

This directory contains git hooks that block AI co-authorship attributions.

## Installation

Configure git to use this hooks directory:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks
```

Or symlink individual hooks:

```bash
# Unix/macOS
ln -sf ../../scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
ln -sf ../../scripts/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg

# Windows (run as admin, or use mklink)
mklink .git\hooks\pre-commit ..\..\scripts\hooks\pre-commit
mklink .git\hooks\commit-msg ..\..\scripts\hooks\commit-msg
```

## Hooks

### pre-commit

Scans staged files for AI co-authorship patterns before allowing commit.

### commit-msg

Scans commit messages for AI co-authorship patterns.

## Blocked Patterns

Both hooks block attribution phrases combined with AI system names.

**Attribution phrases:**
- Co-authored-by (and variations)
- Generated by/with
- Written/Created by
- Assisted by
- With help/assistance from
- Paired with
- AI Author/Contributor

**AI systems:** Major LLM providers and their products.
